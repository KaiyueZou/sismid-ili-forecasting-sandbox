designated_model: true
methods: "VAR(1) model with square root transformation and annual seasonality (period=52). Optimized through extensive model comparison. Captures cross-regional dependencies with minimal lag structure, relying on seasonal component for temporal patterns. All 11 time series (10 HHS regions + national) modeled jointly. Square root transformation stabilizes variance. One-week lag structure (AR1) with annual seasonality captures yearly flu patterns efficiently. Bootstrap method used for prediction intervals. AICc: -49,358, substantially better than VAR(2) alternatives."
